# WARNING! Using this method has some caveats!! USE THIS PART WITH SOME CAUTION!
# CONS of doing this, is that you need to set up your wallpaper (SUPER W) and choose wallpaper.
# CAVEATS! Sometimes the Main Laptop Monitor DOES NOT have display that it needs to re-connect your external monitor
# One work around is to ensure that before shutting down laptop, MAKE SURE your laptop lid is OPEN!!
# Make sure to comment (put # on the both the bindl = , switch ......) above
# NOTE: Display for laptop are being generated into LaptopDisplay.conf
# This part is to be use if you do not want your main laptop monitor to wake up during say wallpaper change etc

# if you think I should replace the Pre-defined Keybinds in ~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf , submit an issue or let me know in DC and present me a valid reason as to why, such as conflicting with global shortcuts, etc etc

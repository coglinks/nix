[![Github-CI][github-ci-badge]][github-ci-link]

The official [MyST (Markedly Structured Text)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) VS Code extension, for extending the Markdown language.

This extension extends VS Code's Markdown language with the following features:

- Extended syntax highlighting
- Hover information and auto-completion for roles and directives
- Extended preview rendering
- Code snippets for role and directive definitions

injects additional elements into the base markdown syntax highlighting grammar, and adds additional language support for MyST specific elements.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Embedded code blocks/cells can be utilised in their native language:

### Hover and Autocompletion

Directive completion and hover is available for all built-in sphinx directives:

Snippet completions are also available for a number of Sphinx directives:

### Preview Enhancement

This extension enhances VS Code's built-in Markdown previewer
([see this guide for info](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/markdown-extension)), to properly render MyST syntax like directives and other extensions.

If you encounter any issues with this, you can disable it with the `myst.preview.enable` [configuration setting][vscode-settings] (and please report it).

You can add MyST syntax extensions with the `myst.preview.extensions` [configuration setting][vscode-settings]. Available extensions:

- `amsmath`: Parse AMS LaTeX math environments
- `deflist`: Parse definition lists
- `dollarmath`: Parse dollar-delimited math (on by default)
- `tasklist`: Parse GitHub style task lists

Note after changing this setting you should reload the VS Code window.

#### CSS Styling

Principally the stylings from [markdown-it-docutils](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-docutils) are used.

The colors are in light mode by default, switching to the dark mode when set by the users operating system.
See the [`prefers-color-scheme` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) for details.

#### A note on dollar-math

From VS Code version `v1.58.0`, VS Code natively supports dollar math rendering ([see here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_58#_math-formula-rendering-in-the-markdown-preview)).
Using the `dollarmath` extension overrides this with some slightly different parsing rules (e.g. dollarmath allows `$$` display math in inline contexts and also labels: `$$a=1$$ (label)`).

If there are still any incompatibilities you can turn off the native support with `markdown.math.enabled` [configuration setting][vscode-settings].

## Working with Markdown

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

- Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
- Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
- Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets

- [Markdown Syntax Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

## Contributing

The main grammar is stored in `syntaxes/myst.tmLanguage`. This file is generated from `myst.tmLanguage.base.yaml`.

See [this guide on textmate bundles](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars), the [VS Code Syntax Highlight guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide), and the [extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) for more help.

### Manual testing

To launch a local version of the extension in VS Code, first ensure the extension build is updated:

```console
$ npm run build
```

Now select the `Launch Extension` configuration in the VS Code `Run and Debug` side panel.
To launch a development version of the extension in VS Code, press `F5`.

### Building the grammar and snippet assets

The grammar is written as a [Jinja template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) YAML file,
with the templates and default variables stored in `template/`

To generate the asset files (grammar and snippets):

```bash
$ npm ci
$ npm run build:assets
```

or with python:

```bash
$ pip install yaml jinja2
$ python src/build.py
```

### Unit and integration testing

The test suite is split into:

- 'integration' tests, which require VS Code to be launched, and
- 'unit' tests, which can be run in the standard fashion with [mocha](https://mochajs.org)

You can run them on the CLI with `npm test`, or separately:

```bash
$ npm run pretest
$ npm run test:unit
$ npm run test:integration
```

Running from the CLI will download and launch a specific version of VS Code (see `src/test/runIntergration.ts`).

Note though, that running integration tests from within VS Code may error (see [Testing extensions tips](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension#using-insiders-version-for-extension-development)).
In this case you can run the tests directly through the `Debug Launcher` in the side panel (see `.vscode/launch.json`). The output can be viewed in the debug console.

The highlighting test cases are stored as markdown files under `test_static/colorize-fixtures`.
Grammar test results are stored under `test_static/colorize-results`, which are automatically generated/updated from the fixtures.
Note though that the fixture results can change between VS Code versions, so you should use the version specified in `src/test/runIntergration.ts`.

### Linting

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

and to auto-fix lints:

```bash
$ npm run lint:fix
```

### Publishing to VS Marketplace

The publishing of the package should be done *via* the Github Actions CI:

1. Bump the version with npm, e.g. `npm version patch -m "ðŸš€ RELEASE: v%s"` (major/minor/patch based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/))
2. Push the commit and tag generated by npm (`git push --follow-tags`)
3. This should trigger the CI action and the `publish` step, check it runs correctly.
